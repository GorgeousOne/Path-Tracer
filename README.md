C++ Path Tracer
===========
This is an experimental project based on the [ray tracer](https://github.com/GorgeousOne/Prog-RayTracer) of a C++ programming course. This time with tracking multiple rays for each pixel.
Of course it's extremely slow because it still only runs on the CPU. The results are pretty though.
